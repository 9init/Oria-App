# FORMAT SELECTION

By default Oria tries to show you the available qualities that average user want to see.

But sometimes you may want to download in a different format, for example when you are on a slow or intermittent connection or you want specific codec. The key mechanism for achieving this is so-called *format selection* based on which you can explicitly specify desired format, select formats based on some criterion or criteria, setup precedence and much more.

You can also use a file extension (currently `3gp`, `aac`, `flv`, `m4a`, `mp4`, `ogg`, `wav`, `webm` are supported) to download the best quality format of a particular file extension served as a single file.
