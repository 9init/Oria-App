    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the Services offered by Oria and does not apply to the information practices
      of other companies and organizations that advertise our Services or Services offered by other companies or
      individuals, including products or sites that may be linked to our Services.<br />
      <span style="font-size: 14pt">WHAT INFORMATION DOES ORIA COLLECT?</span><br />
      The information we collect can be generally placed in two categories:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>data on how the users use our Services;</li>
      <li>aggregate data on the content with which the users engage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We collect information to provide better services to you—from figuring out basic stuff such as which language
      you speak to more complex things such as which ads you will find most useful or which Oria videos you might
      like. The information we collect and how that information is used depends on how you use our Services and
      how you manage your privacy controls.</p>
    <p><strong>You understand and consent that we may provide and share the information to our partners so that they
        too can provide you with an optimal experience, but we never disclose information to a partner in the
        manner that would identify you personally.</strong></p>
    <p>When you are not signed in to a valid account, we use the unique identifiers tied to the application or
      device you are using to collect information. When you are signed in with a third party account, e.g., your
      Google Account, we use that specific account to collect information.</p>
    <p>For greater certainty, whenever you interact with our website or apps, we automatically receive and record
      information including your IP address, “cookie” information, and the page you requested from your browser on
      our server logs. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your computer or mobile device that allow us to
      recognize your computer or device and tell us how and when the Services are visited and by how many people.
      You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your acceptance of
      cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features.</p>
    <p>Whenever you interact with Oria, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs. The
      information we collect includes:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Services usage data. This may include your age and gender, the languages you use, the terms you search
        for, the videos you watch, your views and interactions with content and ads, voice and audio information
        when you use audio features, purchase activity, people with whom you communicate or share content,
        information regarding the version of our software you are using, the location where you download our
        software, how often you launch our software, and which features you use.</li>
      <li>Data on the quality of our Services. This may include the interaction of your devices with our Services,
        such as IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your
        request, and your connection between your phone and your computer.</li>
      <li>Data on user downloads. This may include information regarding which videos you download and your
        average download speed.</li>
      <li>Aggregate statistics on content. This may include the number of contacts you have on your phone, how
        many contacts you have marked as favorites, and the number of apps, songs, videos, or other content you
        have on your phone. This information is only collected as meta-data, without reference to you or your
        contacts’ identities.</li>
      <li>Hardware and software identification. This may include the device type, settings and image resolution,
        operating system, mobile network information including the carrier name and phone number, the version of
        the Android operating system, the size of your device’s screen, and internal storage. We support over
        500 different Android devices and this helps us prioritize support for different kinds of hardware and
        software.</li>
      <li>Location information. We may collect information about your location when you use our Services. Your
        location might be determined by GPS, IP address, sensor data from your device, and the information about
        things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>A few features to note:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>If our software crashed when you were using it, the crash report sent to our server may contain some
        information about the operating system that you use.</li>
      <li>If you download content via our desktop software, we store a copy to your computer so that the next time
        you connect your phone you don’t have to download it again.</li>
      <li>If you provide us with your name and email address, we will use this information for the purpose of
        contacting you regarding our Services and products. You may opt-out of such communications at any time
        by unsubscribing through our Website or contacting us through one of the methods listed at the end of
        this policy.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>The Company does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children under the
        applicable age in your country or knowingly allow such persons to register unless it is upon the
        specific and highlighted consent of at least one of the parents or the legal representatives of the

        the child’s representatives, considering available technologies. When we learn that we have collected
        personal information from a child without parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly
        as possible. Children’s personal data may be collected without the consent mentioned above when the
        collection is necessary to contact the parents or legal representatives, used one single time and not
        stored, or for their protection, and under no circumstances shall the data be passed on to third parties
        without consent as provided herein. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a
        child, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@oria.com">hello@oria.com</a>.</strong></p>
    <p>The data we collect is sent to the Company servers in the USA in aggregate form and added to our system for
      analysis. Our Services will not collect the following information without your specific consent or
      satisfying the preconditions required by applicable laws:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your, your friends’, your cat’s phone numbers</li>
      <li>Any of the content of your text messages, either sent or received</li>
      <li>Your music, photos, video, or any contents you download via our Services</li>

        trade union or religious, philosophical or political organization membership, data concerning health or
        sex life, genetic or biometric data, when related to a natural person</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We will generally retain information for as long as required, allowed or for as long as we believe it useful.
      Even if the processing of personal data is terminated, we may continue to use and disclose your Personal
      Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy as amended from time to time to the extent allowed by
      applicable laws for purposes of</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
      <li>compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation by the controller;</li>
      <li>transfer to third parties; or</li>
      <li>exclusive use of the controller, with access by third parties being prohibited, and provided the data
        has been anonymized.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>We do not purport to have listed all possible disclosures that we might make. This Privacy Policy is intended
      to help you understand our general practices. This policy is not a promise that your information will never
      be disclosed except as described above. For example, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access
      information transmitted to or contained on the site, technologies may malfunction or not work as
      anticipated, or someone might access, abuse or misuse information, despite a lack of permission. Although we
      use what we believe to be commercially reasonable practices to protect your privacy, that does not mean, and
      you should not expect it to mean, that your information or communications will always be private or
      protected.</p>
