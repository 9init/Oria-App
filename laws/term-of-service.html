    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>Last updated: April 2021</p>
    <p><strong>I. Your Relationship with Us and Acceptance of the Terms</strong><br>
      Welcome to Oria (the “Platform”), which is provided by Oria CO., LIMITED (the “Company”, “we” or “us”).</p>
    <p>You are reading the terms of service (the “Terms”), which govern the relationship and serve as an agreement
      between you and us and set forth the terms and conditions by which you may access and use the Platform and
      our related websites, services, applications, products and content (collectively, the “Services”). Your
      access to certain Services or features of the Services may be subject to age restrictions and not available
      to all users of the Services. For purposes of these Terms, “you” and “your” mean you as the user of the
      Services.</p>
    <p>Unless you accept the Terms, you have no right or authorization to use any part of the Services which
      requires you to be a Registered User. By accessing our Services or using our Services, you confirm that you
      can form a binding contract with us, that you accept these Terms and that you agree to comply with them. You
      understand and agree that we will treat your access or use of the Services as acceptance of the Terms from
      that point onwards. Your access to and use of our Services are also subject to our Privacy Policy, which is
      incorporated herein by reference. <strong>By accessing the Services, you agree and represent to
        us:</strong><br>
      <strong>i) that you are at least 12 years of age, or the statutory age of majority in your state of
        nationality and residence, whichever is higher;</strong><br>
      <strong>ii) that you are not restricted from using the Services, by law, by contract, or by us;</strong><br>
      <strong>iii) that you fully agree with the terms and conditions set forth in the Terms;</strong><br>
      <strong>iv) where necessary, your legal guardian has reviewed and consented to these Terms and agreed to be
        responsible for any of your liability arising hereof.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>Your fundamental rights as a Registered User to the Services are mainly set forth in the Terms, so please
      read all of the terms and conditions carefully. The Terms include a clause of dispute resolution by
      arbitration on an individual basis. The venue of such arbitration may not be in the country where you
      reside.</p>
    <p>Please note that our services are not made available in, or to residents of, the European Union or
      Switzerland.</p>
    <p><strong>II. Changes to the Terms</strong><br>
      Due to fast-developing technologies and law and policies, as well as volatile market conditions, the Company
      reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify or revise the Terms from time to time at any time, and
      to the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to be bound by such modifications or revisions. Any
      such modified or revised version will be effective at the time we first post it onto our Platform (or at any
      other time designated in the terms of such version, if any). We will use commercially reasonable efforts to
      generally notify all users of any material changes to these Terms, such as through a notice on our Platform.
      However, you should look at the Terms regularly to check for such changes. We will also put the “Last
      Updated” date at the top of the Terms, which reflects the effective date of such Terms. Your continued use
      of the Services thereafter will constitute your acceptance of, and consent to, such modifications or
      revisions. If you object to any such modification or revision, your sole recourse shall be ceasing to use
      all of the Services.</p>
    <p><strong>III. USER RIGHTS AND LICENSES</strong><br>
      1. Rights to Access the Services<br>
      A. The Services provide an Internet platform offering comprehensive software and network services, online

        restrict access to the Services;</strong><br>
      <strong>viii) incorporate the Services or any portion thereof into any other program or product. In such
        case, we reserve the right to refuse to provide any Services, terminate accounts or limit access to the

      <strong>ix) use automated scripts to collect information from or otherwise interact with the
        Services;</strong><br>
      <strong>x) impersonate any person or entity, or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent you or your

      <strong>xiv) use the Services to upload, transmit, distribute, store or otherwise make available in any way:
        files that contain viruses, trojans, worms, logic bombs or other material that is malicious or
        technologically harmful;</strong><br>
      <strong>xv) provide any answers, responses, comments, opinions, analysis or recommendations that you are not
        properly licensed or otherwise qualified to provide; or material that, in the sole judgment of the
        Company, is objectionable or which restricts or inhibits any other person from using the Services, or
        which may expose the Company, the Services or its users to any harm or liability of any type of attack,
        hack, interfere with other user’s use of, reverse-engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source
        code of, the Service or any part thereof;</strong><br>
      <strong>xvi) conduct any action that may infringe or jeopardize the lawful rights or interests of any
        person, entity and/or the Company;</strong>
    </p>
    <p>The Company reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable access to content
      at its discretion for any reason or no reason.</p>
    <p>2. License of the App<br>
      A. The App consists of computer programs and integrated or peripheral contents which may contain copyrighted
      material. The App made available to you is licensed, not sold, to you. Your license to each of the App is
      subject to your prior acceptance of the Terms. The Company reserves all rights in and to the App that are
      not expressly granted to you under the Terms.</p>
    <p>B. Subject to your compliance with the Terms and any applicable laws and regulations, the Company grants you
      a conditional, limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to store,
      install, use and uninstall the App on any computing devices (including but not limited to desktop and
      portable computers, tablets or pads, smartphones, Internet TVs and wearable devices) that you own or
      control, solely for your personal, non-commercial use. Unless otherwise provided to the contrary, the Terms
      govern any and all content, material, and services accessible from or purchased within the App as well as
      upgrades and patches provided by the Company.</p>
    <p>C. Except as expressly provided in the Terms, you shall not rent, sell, transfer, redistribute or sublicense
      the App. If you sell your computing device to a third party, you must remove the App from such device, or at
      least logout and erase all records in relation to your use (and your user account with us, if any) of the
      App.</p>
    <p>D. You shall not make use of errors, bugs or defects of the App, and shall not develop, distribute,
      disseminate or use any program, software or scripts which may cast detriment to us or the App.</p>
    <p>3. Use of Data</p>
    <p>You agree that the Company may collect and use technical data and related information including but not
      limited to technical information about your device, system, network access, and other software and
      peripherals installed on your devices. These may be gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of the
      Services, inclusive of customer service, technical support, and other services to you (if any) related to
      the Services. The Company may use this information to improve its products or to provide services or
      technologies to you or third parties, as long as it is in a form that is not capable of personally
      identifying you.</p>
    <p>4. Except for the permissions and rights expressly granted in the Terms, no other licenses or rights are
      granted to you by implication or otherwise under the Terms.</p>
    <p>5. Your Account</p>
    <p>A. You need to log in with a third-party account before you use our Services (the “Account”).</p>
    <p>B. When you access some part of the Services, you may be prompted to provide us certain information, or
      log-in with an existing Account. You represent and warrant that the information you provide to us at any and
      all times will be true, accurate, current, and complete. If any such information changes, you agree to
      forthwith update such information to us. You become a registered user (“Registered User”) of our Services
      once you log in with your third-party account or phone number and cease to be a Registered User when you no
      longer maintain an Account with us.</p>
    <p>C. You may choose a combination of certain characters (letters, digits and other characters) unused by other
      users as your nickname. We reserve the right to restrict the use of certain such combinations for legal
      compliance purposes or prevention of personal attack, humiliation, intellectual property rights infringement
      or other improper use of the Account.</p>
    <p>D. You are primarily responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials (including
      without limitation your account number (ID), username, password) and are fully responsible for all
      activities that occur through the use of your credentials or otherwise on or through your Account. You agree
      to notify us immediately if you believe the confidentiality of your login credentials has been compromised
      or if you suspect any unauthorized use of your Account. You agree that we will not be liable for any loss or
      damage arising from unauthorized use of your login credentials.</p>
    <p>E. We retain ownership of the Account. You enjoy only the right to use your Account during the period that
      you maintain it with us. Your Account shall be exclusively used by you. Any form of lending, borrowing,
      renting, transferring, gifting or selling of such Account is prohibited and shall be null and void. You are
      liable for any and all activities done using your Account, even if such activities are not actually
      conducted by you. If we detect any inconsistency between the actual user of an Account and the person who
      owns it, or it is in dispute on who shall be the legitimate user of an Account, we have the right to
      recover, withdraw, suspend (freeze) or terminate such Account in our discretion, without any notice or any
      liability to any person. The loss and damage arising thereof, including but not limited to the loss of
      communication, data and virtual properties, shall be assumed solely by the user.</p>
    <p>F. For safety, compliance, operational or other concerns, and on a reasonable ground (for example, the
      Account is inactive for a long period and is wasting service resources), we reserve the right to suspend
      (freeze), terminate or reclaim your Account in our sole discretion, temporarily or permanently, with or
      without notice, giving reasons or not, and without any liability to you.</p>
    <p><strong>IV. LAWFUL AND PROPER USAGE OF THE SERVICES</strong><br>
      As a precondition and requirement for your access to and use of the Services, you are obliged to always
      observe certain rules during your access to and use of the Services.</p>
    <p>Since we provide merely a tool, a platform, or a place for our users to enjoy different contents, and/or
      communicate with each other, it is the users (including you) themselves who make up this community. Each
      user shall be responsible for his/her own actions, behavior, and conducts when receiving and participating
      in the Services. We do not actively monitor and are not responsible for any activity or content that is made
      or provided by the users; however, we expect the users to conduct their actions and behavior in a friendly
      and legitimate way.</p>
    <p>1. You are encouraged to:<br>
      i) use the Services with your friends; tell them about the Site and App if they do not know them yet;<br>
      ii) communicate friendly with other users of the Services;<br>
      iii) make connections with other users and have greater fun;<br>
      iv) make more positive comments and feedback.</p>
    <p>2. Consequences of Misuse of the Services</p>
    <p>A. If you violate applicable laws, regulations, the Terms and/or our other agreements or terms and conditions
      you accepted, we have the right to make judgments in our discretion but in accordance with relevant rules,
      and take one or more countermeasures or penalties as we consider commensurate to your violation, including
      but not limited to:<br>
      i) removal of non-compliant content;<br>
      ii) restricting or terminating the provision of certain portions, features or functions of the Services to
      you;<br>
      iii) suspension or termination of your Account, and/or limitation or denial of further service to you;
      and<br>
      iv) post public notices to expose and condemn your violation.</p>
    <p>B. Multiple or repeated violations and misconducts, and cases of extreme severity, may result in more serious
      consequences, as we reasonably consider.</p>
    <p>C. You agree to indemnify and hold the Company, its parents, subsidiaries, and affiliates, and each of their
      respective officers, directors, employees, agents, and advisors harmless from and against any loss,
      liability, claim, demand, damages, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees, arising out of
      or in connection with:<br>
      i) your use of and access to the Services;<br>
      ii) your violation of any term of the Terms;<br>
      iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any copyright, property, or
      privacy right or any third-party agreement; or<br>
      iv) any of your content or information in your Account or any other information you post or share on or
      through the Services.</p>
    <p><strong>V. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</strong><br>
      1. Ownership<br>
      A. Platform Materials. All rights, title, and interest in and to all materials that are part of the Services
      (including, but not limited to, designs, text, graphics, pictures, video, information, applications,
      software, music, sound and other files, and their selection and arrangement) with the exception of
      User-Generated Content (collectively, the “Platform Materials”), are, as between the Company and you, owned
      by the Company and/or its third-party licensors. Use of Platform Materials for any purpose not expressly
      permitted by these Terms is strictly prohibited. You acknowledge and agree that you shall not acquire any
      ownership rights whatsoever by downloading and/or using the Platform Materials. You agree that you shall not
      modify, copy, distribute, frame, reproduce, republish, download, scrape, display, post, transmit, or sell in
      any form or by any means, in whole or in part, or otherwise exploit the Platform Materials without our
      express prior written permission. You acknowledge that you do not acquire any ownership rights by using the
      Services or by accessing any Platform Materials posted on the Services by the Company, or any derivative
      works thereof. All rights not expressly granted by these Terms are reserved by the Company and its
      licensors, and no license is granted hereunder by estoppel, implication, or otherwise.</p>
    <p>You acknowledge and agree that when you view content provided on the Services, you are doing so at your own
      risk. The content on the Services is provided for general information only. It is not intended to amount to
      advice on which you should rely. You must obtain professional or specialist advice before taking, or
      refraining from, any action on the basis of the content on our Services.</p>
    <p>We make no representations, warranties or guarantees, whether express or implied, that any content (including
      User-Generated Content) is accurate, complete or up to date. Where our Services contain links to other sites
      and resources provided by third parties, these links are provided for your information only. We have no
      control over the contents of those sites or resources. Such links should not be interpreted as approval by
      us of those linked websites or information you may obtain from them. You acknowledge that we have no
      obligation to pre-screen, monitor, review, or edit any content posted on the platform (including
      User-Generated Content).</p>
    <p>B. User-Generated Content (User Content). Users may be permitted to upload, post or transmit or otherwise
      make available content through the Services including, without limitation, any text, photographs, user
      videos, sound recordings and the musical works embodied therein, including videos that incorporate locally
      stored sound recordings from your personal music library and ambient noise. Users may also extract all or
      any portion of User Content created by another user to produce additional User Content, including
      collaborative User Content with other users, that combine and intersperse User Content generated by more
      than one user. The information and materials in the User Content have not been verified or approved by us.
      The views expressed by other users on the Services do not represent our views or values.</p>
    <p>You represent and warrant that: (a) your User-Generated Content is original to you and that you exclusively
      own the rights to such content, including the right to grant all of the rights and licenses in the Terms
      without the Company incurring any third party obligations or liability arising out of its exercise of such
      rights and licenses; or (b) you have received all necessary permissions, clearances from, or are authorized
      by, the owner of any part of the content to submit it to the Services, to transmit it from the Services to
      other third party platforms, and/or adopt any third party content. If you only own the rights in and to a
      sound recording, but not to the underlying musical works embodied in such sound recordings, then you must
      not post such sound recordings to the Services unless you have all permissions, clearances from, or are
      authorized by, the owner of any part of the content to submit it to the Services. All of your User-Generated
      Content is of your sole responsibility and the Company is not responsible for any material that you (and
      other users) upload, post, or otherwise make available. <strong>By uploading, distributing, transmitting or
        otherwise using your User-Generated Content with the Services, you grant to us an unconditional
        irrevocable, perpetual, nonexclusive, fully transferable, royalty-free, sub-licensable, and worldwide
        license to use, host, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from,
        distribute, perform, and display your User-Generated Content in any format and on any platform, either
        now known or hereinafter invented, in connection with operating, providing and promoting the Services.
        You further grant us a royalty-free license to use your user name, image, voice, and likeness to
        identify you as the source of any of your User-Generated Content; provided, however, that your ability
        to provide an image, voice, and likeness may be subject to limitations due to age
        restrictions.&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p>The Company does not guarantee the accuracy, quality, or integrity of any User-Generated Content appeared on
      the Services. By using the Services, you acknowledge and accept that you may be exposed to material you find
      offensive or objectionable. You agree that the Company will not under any circumstances be liable for any
      User-Generated Content, including, but not limited to, errors in any User-Generated Content, or any loss or
      damage incurred by the use of such User-Generated Content. The Company reserves the right to remove and
      permanently delete your User-Generated Content from the Services with or without notice for any reason or no
      reason. You may notify the Company of any User-Generated Content that you believe violates the Terms, or
      other inappropriate user behavior, by reporting to our customer service.</p>
    <p>For the avoidance of doubt, the rights granted in the preceding paragraphs of this Section include, but are
      not limited to, the right to reproduce sound recordings (and make mechanical reproductions of the musical
      works embodied in such sound recordings), and publicly perform and communicate to the public sound
      recordings (and the musical works embodied therein), all on a royalty-free basis. This means that you are
      granting us the right to use your User-Generated Content without the obligation to pay royalties to any
      third party, including, but not limited to, a sound recording copyright owner (e.g., a record label), a
      musical work copyright owner (e.g., a music publisher), a performing rights organization (e.g., ASCAP, BMI,
      SESAC, etc.) (a “PRO”), a sound recording PRO (e.g., SoundExchange), any unions or guilds, and engineers,
      producers or other royalty participants involved in the creation of User-Generated Content.</p>
    <p>Specific Rules for Musical Works and for Recording Artists. If you are a composer or author of a musical work
      and are affiliated with a PRO, then you must notify your PRO of the royalty-free license you grant through
      these Terms in your User-Generated Content to us. You are solely responsible for ensuring your compliance
      with the relevant PRO’s reporting obligations. If you have assigned your rights to a music publisher, then
      you must obtain the consent of such music publisher to grant the royalty-free license(s) set forth in these
      Terms in your User-Generated Content or have such music publisher enter into these Terms with us. Just
      because you authored a musical work (e.g., wrote a song) does not mean you have the right to grant us the
      licenses in these Terms. If you are a recording artist under contract with a record label, then you are
      solely responsible for ensuring that your use of the Services is in compliance with any contractual
      obligations you may have to your record label, including if you create any new recordings through the
      Services that may be claimed by your label.</p>
    <p>Through-To-The-Audience Rights. All of the rights you grant in your User-Generated Content in these Terms are
      provided on a through-to-the-audience basis, meaning the owners or operators of third party services will
      not have any separate liability to you or any other third party for User-Generated Content posted or used on
      such third party service via the Services.</p>
    <p><strong>Waiver of Rights to User Content. By posting User-Generated Content to or through the Services, you
        waive any rights to prior inspection or approval of any marketing or promotional materials related to
        such Content. You also waive any and all rights of privacy, publicity, or any other rights of a similar
        nature in connection with your User-Generated Content, or any portion thereof. To the extent any moral
        rights are not transferable or assignable, you hereby waive and agree never to assert any and all moral
        rights, or to support, maintain or permit any action based on any moral rights that you may have in or
        with respect to any User-Generated Content you post to or through the Services.</strong></p>
    <p>We also have the right to disclose your identity to any third party who is claiming that any User-Generated
      Content posted or uploaded by you to our Services constitutes a violation of their intellectual property
      rights, or of their right to privacy.</p>
    <p>We, or authorized third parties, reserve the right to cut, crop, edit or refuse to publish, your content at
      our or their sole discretion. We have the right – but not the obligation – to remove, disallow, block or
      delete any post you make on our Services in our sole discretion (i) that we consider to violate these Terms,
      or (ii) in response to complaints from other users or third parties, with or without notice and without any
      liability to you. As a result, we recommend that you save copies of any User-Generated Content that you post
      to the Services on your personal device(s) in the event that you want to ensure that you have permanent
      access to copies of such Content. We do not guarantee the accuracy, integrity, appropriateness or quality of
      any User-Generated Content, and under no circumstances will we be liable in any way for any User-Generated
      Content.</p>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to expeditiously remove from our Services any infringing material that we become
      aware of.</p>
    <p>2.Copyright Complaints<br>
      A. Notification. If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright
      infringement, you should notify us of your infringement claim in accordance with the procedure set forth
      below. The Company will process and investigate notices of alleged infringement and will take appropriate
      actions under applicable intellectual property laws with respect to any alleged or actual infringement. A
      notification of claimed copyright infringement should be emailed to our copyright complaint email address at
      hello@oria.com. To be effective, the notification must be in writing, and contain the following
      information:<br>
      i) an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the

      1.Termination and Interruption<br>
      A. You may apply for termination of your Account at any time and for any reason by sending an application to
      our customer service team. The Company may terminate your Account and your access to the Services if the
      Company finds your application reasonable and acceptable. The Company is not obliged to provide the Services
      unless required by applicable law. Therefore, the Company may terminate the Services in its entirety, or any
      part thereof, without giving a reason, notice, and compensation to you. The Company is not required to
      provide you with any notice or warning prior to any such termination. You may, as the result of the
      termination, lose your Account and all information and data associated therewith, and the Company is under
      no obligation to compensate you for any such loss.</p>
    <p>B. The Company reserves the right to deny the access of any user to the Services without notice for any
      reason, including but not limited to a violation of the Terms. If you violate the Terms, the Company
      reserves the right to issue you a warning regarding the violation or immediately terminate or suspend any or
      all Accounts you have created using the Services. You agree that the Company needs not to provide you any
      notice before terminating or suspending your Account, but it may do so.</p>
    <p>C. You understand that we need to perform scheduled or unscheduled repairs and maintenance of the Services.
      If such situations cause an interruption of Services for a reasonable duration, we shall not bear any
      liability to you and/or to any third parties. However, we shall provide notice to you as soon as
      practicable.</p>
    <p>2.Modification<br>
      The Company reserves the right to change, modify, reprice, or discontinue (temporarily or permanently) the
      Services or any part thereof, with or without notice to you. You have the right to discontinue the use of
      the Services if you do not agree to such changes to the Services or the Terms made by us. Continued use of
      the Services shall be deemed as an acceptance of such changes.</p>
    <p><strong>IX. GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION</strong><br>
      1.Governing Law<br>
      By accepting the Terms or becoming a Registered User, you agree that the laws of Egypt, and regardless of
      your location, will govern the Terms and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and the
      Company.</p>
    <p>2. Dispute Resolution<br>
      A. Any dispute, controversy, difference or claim arising out of or relating to the Terms, including the
      existence, validity, interpretation, performance, breach or termination thereof or any dispute regarding
      non-contractual obligations arising out of or relating to it shall be referred to and finally resolved by
      arbitration administered by The Cairo Regional Centre for International Commercial Arbitration (“CRCICA”)
      under the CRCICA Administered Arbitration Rules in force when the notice of arbitration is submitted.</p>
    <p>B. The seat of arbitration shall be Egypt. The number of arbitrators shall be one. The arbitration
      proceedings shall be conducted in English.</p>
    <p>C. If the arbitration clauses above are determined to be totally invalid or non-enforceable, then any
      dispute, controversy, difference or claim arising out of or relating to the Terms shall be decided
      exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in Egypt, and you hereby consent to and waive all
      defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non-conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in
      the territory and the courts of Egypt.</p>
    <p>D. You acknowledge that the rights granted and obligations made to the Company under the Terms are of a
      unique and irreplaceable nature, the loss of which may result in immediate and irreparable harm to the
      Company for which remedies at law are inadequate. The Company shall therefore be entitled to seek injunctive
      or other equitable relief (without the obligation to post any bond or surety) in the event of any breach or
      anticipatory breach by you. You irrevocably waive all rights to seek injunctive or other equitable relief.
    </p>
    <p>3.User Disputes<br>
      You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Services and other parties that you
      come in contact with through the Services. The Company hereby disclaims any and all liability to you or any
      third party relating to your use of the Service. The Company reserves the right, but has no obligation, to
      manage disputes between you and other users of the Services.</p>
    <p><strong>X. MISCELLANEOUS</strong><br>
      <strong>Entire Agreement.</strong> These Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and the
      Company and govern your use of the Services and completely replace any prior agreements between you and the
      Company in relation to the Services.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Links.</strong> You may link to our home page, provided you do so in a way that is fair and legal and
      does not damage our reputation or take advantage of it. You must not establish a link in such a way as to
      suggest any form of association, approval, or endorsement on our part where none exists. You must not
      establish a link to our Services in any website that is not owned by you. The website in which you are
      linking must comply in all respects with the content standards set out in the Terms. We reserve the right to
      withdraw linking permission without notice.</p>
    <p><strong>No Waiver.</strong> Our failure to insist upon or enforce any provision of these Terms shall not be
      construed as a waiver of any provision or right.</p>
    <p><strong>Security.</strong> We do not guarantee that our Services will be secure or free from bugs or viruses.
      You are responsible for configuring your information technology, computer programs, and platform to access
      our Services. You should use your own virus protection software.</p>
    <p><strong>Severability.</strong> If any court of law, having jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that
      any provision of these Terms is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the Terms without
      affecting the rest of the Terms, and the remaining provisions of the Terms will continue to be valid and
      enforceable.</p>
    <p><strong>Headings.</strong> The section headings used herein are for convenience only and shall not be given
      any legal import. Upon the Company’s request, you will furnish the Company with any documentation,
      substantiation, or releases necessary to verify your compliance with the Terms.</p>
    <p><strong>Survival.</strong> You agree that the provisions of the Terms that by their nature should survive
      termination will survive any termination of these Terms.</p>
    <p><strong>Class Action Waiver.</strong> Any Claim must be brought in the respective party’s individual
      capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative,
      multiple plaintiffs, or similar proceeding (“Class Action”). The parties expressly waive any ability to
      maintain any Class Action in any forum. If the Claim is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator will not have
      authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action nor make an award to any person
      or entity not a party to the arbitration. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is
      unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction
      and not by an arbitrator. The parties understand that any right to litigate in court, to have a judge or
      jury decide their case, or to be a party to a class or representative action, is waived, and that any claims
      must be decided individually, through arbitration. If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable,
      then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement, if otherwise effective, will be null and void. The
      arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief
      and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If for any
      reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and the Company each waive any right to a
      jury trial.</p>
    <p><strong>Third-Party Services and Rights.</strong> We use third-party services to help us provide the
      Services, but such use does not indicate that we endorse them or are responsible or liable for their
      actions. By accessing or using our Services, you are also agreeing to be bound by any applicable third-party

      websites or the organizations sponsoring such third-party websites or their products or services, whether or

      any loss or damage of any sort incurred as a result of any such dealings you may have on or through a
      third-party website or as a result of the presence of any third-party advertising on the Services. You
      hereby agree that we have the right to, when providing Services, place any type of commercial or

      limited to, the placement of advertisements on any page of The Site); you also agree to receive promotional
      or other relevant commercial information from us via email, short message service (SMS) or other methods, to
